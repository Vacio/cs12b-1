1.  Overview

In this assignment, you will learn how to access files, and make use
of command line arguments by writing a utility similar to the program
fmt(1).  Read the man page for fmt by typeing the command:
   man -s 1 fmt
Whenever you see the name of a command in bold face followed by a
number in parentheses, it refers to a command in a certain section of
the Unix man pages.  In this case, section 1 contains the
documentation for the program fmt.  Your program will be similar but
not identical.  Follow the specification given here.  There is also a
reference implementation written in Perl.

2.  Program Specification

We present the program specification in the form of a Unix man(1)
page.

NAME
     jfmt -- simple text formatter

SYNOPSIS
     jfmt [-width] [filename...]

DESCRIPTION
     The format utility reads in text lines from all of its input
     files and writes its output to stdout.  Error messages are
     written to stderr.  Each file is handled separately, and within
     each file, all consecutive sequences of lines containing non-
     whitespace characters are considered as a single paragraph.  A
     paragraph is written out with a maximal sequence of words not to
     exceed the specified output line width.  It is then followed by
     one empty line.

OPTIONS

     -width
          The specified width is the maximum number of characters in
          an output line.  If a word that is longer than width is
          found, it is printed on a line by itself.  The default width
          is 65 characters.

OPERANDS
     Each operand is a file name, and they are read in sequence.  An
     option is recognized as such only if it begins with a minus sign
     and precedes all operands.  If any operand is specified as a
     single minus sign (-), then stdin is read at that point.

EXIT STATUS

     0    All files were read successfully, output was sucessfully
          generated, and no errors were detected.

     1    Errors were detected and messages were written to stderr.

SEE ALSO
     fmt(1), pfmt.perl.

3.  Implementation Sequence

Whenever your write a program that is non-trivial, you should follow
some iplementation sequence that develops a program a little bit at a
time, keeping a working program and adding to it little by little.
Make backups frequently.

 (1) Start with the given code:  The code/ subdirectory contains some
     starter code for yor project.  The misc/ subdirectory contains
     some examples you should study, but which are not directly
     useable in your code.

 (2) Make sure checksource and cid are in your path.  The first checks
     on basic formatting, and the second will check your code into an
     RCS archive.

 (3) Play around with pfmt.perl to see what your program should do.
     If you copy this file into your development directory, make sure
     the x-bit is on.

 (4) The program jfmt.java, as given, merely cycles through the files
     and prints debug code.  Each line is printed as it is read, and
     each word within that line is read.  Note that words are selected
     from a line with a white space regular expression passed to
     split.  "\\s+" is a string representing the regular expression
     \s+, which matches any sequence of white space.

 (5) As you are developing Java code, you should have your browser
     pointed at
        http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/index.html,
     which is the Java Platform, Standard Edition 6 API Specification.

 (6) Your program should have the following import statements at the
     beginning:
        import java.io.*;
        import java.util.Iterator;
        import java.util.LinkedList;
        import java.util.List;
        import java.util.Scanner;
        import static java.lang.System.*;
     Important note:  In this assignment, you may use anything in
     java.util, but in general in this course you are prohibited from
     using anything from that package except when explicitly
     authorized.  See the syllabus for a list of classes in java.util
     that you may always use.

 (7) Read about interface java.util.List and class java.util.
     LinkedList.  Then, at the beginning of the function format, add
     in the following declaration:
        List<String> words = new LinkedList<String> ();
     Delete the line that echos input lines and instead of printing
     the words found in each line, add them to the list of words.
     Note that you need to take special care not to add an empty
     leading word to the list of words.  (What does split do when
     there is a space ahead of the first word?)

 (8) Create a function printparagraph which is called whenever you see
     the end of a paragraph.  This function removes and prints each
     word in the list.  The end of a paragraph occurs at end of file.
     It also occurs with an empty line, i.e., a line that contains
     only spaces and tabs or nothing at all.  Sequences of empty lines
     produce the same output as a single empty line.

 (9) Look at interface java.util.Iterator.  The function
     printparagraph should create an iterator over the list:
        for (String word: words)
     As you iterate over each word, print it, with a space between
     words, but not before the first word, nor after the last word of
     the line.  Whenever printing a word would exceed the line length,
     print a newline character.  Note that the first word on a line is
     printed whether or not it exceeds the line length.

(10) When you are finished with the list, empty it:
        words.clear ();

(11) An alternative method is to create a StringBuffer to accumulate
     words until the line is full.  In this case, don't use string
     concatenation (+).  Use StringBuffer.append.  This is what the
     inner loop of the Perl code does.  Study it an duplicate its
     functionality.  Use diff(1) to check the output of your program
     against that of pfmt.perl.

(12) Add code to examine args to see if there is a maximum line length
     parameter, and if so, keep it in a variable.  If args[0] exists,
     it is a valid option if args[0].matches ("-\\d+"), an invalid
     option if args[0].matches ("-.+"), and otherwise not an option at
     all.

(13) A string may be converted to an integer by using Integer.parseInt
     (see the Java 1.5 API documentation for java.lang.Integer).  You
     can either use substring to ignore the minus sign, or negate the
     result after conversion.  Note that any word from the command
     line that equals ("-") is not an option, but an operand.  Instead
     of bothering to check for formatting using the matches function
     in the previous point, You could just assume it is valid, but use
     a try-catch construct to catch a NumberFormatException if not.

4.  Scripts

There are scripts cid, testsubmit, and checksource in my course bin
directory.  To make them available for your use without typing in the
full pathname, add them to your path.

If you use bash, add the following line to ~/.bashrc:
   export PATH="$PATH:/afs/cats.ucsc.edu/courses/cmps012b-wm/bin"
To make sure this also happens with a login shell, type the following
in at the command line:
   cd
   ln -s .bashrc .bash_profile
   . .bashrc

If you use csh or tcsh, add the following to ~/.cshrc:
   set path=($path /afs/cats.ucsc.edu/courses/cmps012b-wm/bin)
After you do that, source the file from the command line:
   source ~/.cshrc
For either shell, you need to do that only once.  Next time you log
in, you will automatically get my directory in your path.

5.  Program Testing

It is extremely important to test your program and verify that it
works under all possible circumstances.  The subdirectory .score
contains some files:  SCORE is the grader's score sheet, to be used to
evaluate your program.  After submitting your code, run testsubmit and
then cd into the directory.  Copy the files mk.build and mk.test and
run them to verify that your program works.

To see exactly what testing should look like, copy the input files
into your baseline directory (separate from your development
directory), make a symbolic link to make jfmt point at pfmt.perl and
see what output the Perl program produces.  Your output should be
identical, including stdin, stdout, and the exit status.

6.  What to Submit

Submit the files README, Makefile, jfmt.java.  If you are doing pair
programming, be sure to edit your README, as required in the pair
programming directory, and add the PARTNER file to your submit list.

Verify the submit!  This is explained in lab1.  If you don't submit
all of the necessary code, you will lose many points.  Do not submit
the jar file or any class files.  Make sure your Makefile works.  Do a
pre-grade using the information in the .score subdirectory.
